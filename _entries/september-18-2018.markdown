### CHINA CUP RUGBY CHAMPS!

JV and Varsity boys brought home China Cup Championships last weekend before the typhoon roared into town. JV and Varsity girls finished their tournament as runners up! Exciting finals against SAS-PX will set up great varsity APAC's a month from now in Shanghai.

### CHINA CUP VOLLEYBALL

Dragon Volleyballers had a successful weekend in Shanghai with JV girls narrowly losing in the finals 13-15 in the third set against the homestay Eagles. JV boys and Varsity girls won their consolation games to finish 3rd while Varsity boys finished fourth but gained a lot of valuable court experience for future games ahead. All teams looking forward to rematches at JPAC and APAC coming next month!!\
