# HKIS Dragons

This is the sports site for HKIS. Built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Bulma](https://bulma.io/), and hosted on [Siteleaf](https://www.siteleaf.com/).

## Development

Clone this repository or download the code. The site uses Ruby 2.4.3, so you will have to install that with a Ruby version manager.

You will have to install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with the following (instructions are also on their site):

    $ gem install bundler jekyll

With Terminal, navigate to the directory. To install gems, run:

    $ bundle install

To start the local development server, run:

    $ bundle exec jekyll serve

You will be able to see the site at `http://localhost:4000`. Add pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test the site's contents.

## Contributing

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome.
